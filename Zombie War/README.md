The game has three main Components :- 
Zombies ^O^ ^o^,  
Battlefield 
And the  Rival *x*

Zombies are arrogant because the battlefield belongs to them and they have a huge army.

Before the game starts
Zombies ask the rival to enter his ‘name’ and the ‘number of zombies’ the rival wants to fight

The rival fights against normal zombies and the ancient zombies
As the name suggests the ancient zombies are old and much more powerful

If the rival wins against the zombies and survives, he wins the game
The zombies will retreat and the battlefield will be owned by the rival
But if the rival dies 
The zombies will wait for the next rival
Because zombies are always ready to fight!!
